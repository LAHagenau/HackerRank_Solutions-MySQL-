# Generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark.
# Don't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. 
# The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
# If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. 
# Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. 
# If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.
