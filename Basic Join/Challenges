# Problem: Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
# Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order.
# If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
# If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, 
# then exclude those students from the result.
